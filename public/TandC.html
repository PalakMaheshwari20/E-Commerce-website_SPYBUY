        <div class="content">
        <strong>Situations where Buyer Protection Program Works:</strong><br>
        In case of a dispute where the Seller is unable to provide a refund or a replacement, SPY BUY will actively work towards reaching a resolution.
        The Buyer Protection Program covers Buyers who are unable to successfully resolve their dispute with the Seller or are not satisfied the resolution provided by the Seller.
        The Buyer can write to SPY BUY if the issue with the Seller is not resolved. SPY BUY's Customer Support team will look into the case to check for possible fraud and if the Buyer has been blacklisted/blocked from making purchases on the Website. Only after verifying these facts, a dispute can be registered.
        In due course of resolution, SPY BUY's Customer Support Team will facilitate a conference call including the Seller and the Buyer.
        When a dispute has been raised, SPY BUY may provide both the parties access to each other's Display Names, contact details including email addresses and other details pertaining to the dispute. Buyers and Sellers are subject to final consent from SPY BUY for settling the dispute.

        There is a limitation period of 45 days in which you have to file the complaint.
        The first step which a buyer should take is contact the seller to resolve the dispute. If the Buyer doesn't hear from the Seller or is unable to resolve the issue with the Seller even after contact, a dispute can be raised with  by writing an email to SPY BUY.
        Buyers can make a maximum of 5 claims per year on SPY BUY. If the claim was withdrawn, it is not counted. The coverage amount will be limited to ₹50,000.
